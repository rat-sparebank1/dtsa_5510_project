# dtsa_5510_project

This project explores different data pre-processing techniques for a text-based problem and how we can use several clustering algorithms and matrix operations to cluster text data.

For this project I used Google Play Store App reviews dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prakharrathi25/google-play-store-reviews)

The project and the data can be found in a GitHub repo too: https://github.com/rat-sparebank1/dtsa_5510_project

The project compares the accuracies of the different scenarioes.
